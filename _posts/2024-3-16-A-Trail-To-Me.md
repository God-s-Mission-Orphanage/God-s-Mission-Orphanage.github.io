> A trail to me.

There were once two cities at war, but one city could not stand it any longer. So this city decided to strategise for the next battle.
The counsellor of the king in this being-defeated-city had come and told the king, "king, this war is too fierce. If we continue to fight like this, it may become the end of us. We should try something else." The king then starting to think of things to do, came up with the following idea: "In this town, there are many dogs." He said. "Let's kill all of them then we will be safe from our enemies."

After the decree went out, all the dogs had to be killed in the city.<br>
There was one man however who liked his dogs so much that he would much rather kill himself than killing his dog. His dog was his only source of comfort and his source of wealth, as he was also a police officer. So this man decided to lock his dog in a bedroom in his house instead of killing it.

Meanwhile at the king’s palace, the king asks his counsellors, “have people killed all their dogs?” the counsellor said “they have". “Have you verified every in household?” the king asked, “we checked with each household owner.” the counsellor replied. “Alright.” The king said. “Now let’s all move out of this town to a different one so we can be free from the battles.” The king decreed.

The king, not wanting his soldiers or his population to perish, embarked on an exodus out of the town, leaving everything behind, but the bare necessities.<br>
As they were walking, the counsellor warned. "King. If we continue to walk like this the enemy will follow our footprints and find us.  Let's instead walk upstream within the river over there so that our footprints will be well hidden."

To this, the king commanded that everyone walk inside the river only, then the whole population started to walk upstream.

After three days of hiking, they reached the source of the river on top of a mountain covered with hay.

The king and the counsellors then decided to stop at this mountain and build a new city there, because if they went further up, they would have to struggle for water.

When this was executed, a new city was born.

Two weeks later, their enemies arriving at the old town, found nothing but a ghost town. Even the footprints that lead them to the river had disappeared.

Plundering and demolishing house after house, they found a dog.

"King, king, we found a dog!", they screamed.

"Bring it to me." Their king commanded.

"Do not kill it!" He added.

They then unravelled the dog, and started watching it.
"In the same direction it will go, it that direction we shall follow." The king advised.

The dog then started to walk in the direction of the river, and they started to follow it.

When they arrived at the river, the dog started sniffing the water.

Then the dog started to walk upstream.

When they saw the dog walking upstream, they were all startled at first. 

After three days of following the dog upstream and just when they were about to give up hope they started hearing noises.

The king from the enemy's side then realised and said, "So here is where they came to hide!".
He then commanded, "Let's surround the city in an ambush, and burn everything. Kill everyone!"

The population on the hill, not knowing they were being surrendered, suddenly saw a dog appearing in front of them from out of nowhere.

Asking each other where the dog came from, they didn't even finish to get surprised before the fire consumed them.

Escapers of the flames being killed by arrows, the enemy camp became victorious.

The end.

## Meaning

When we are always told to kill bad thoughts, lies, pride, ego, ... because there are forces of darkness `(Ephesians 6:12)` that are chasing us guided by those thoughts, those lies, that pride, that ego, but we take it lightly.<br>
Take the story of Adam and Eve. Dissatisfaction of the position God had given them conducted the devil to tempt them. Thus, dissatisfaction was a dog that guided the devil to Adam and Eve's disobedience.

We say "this is a justified bad action", "a necessary lie", "a reason not to forgive."

Yes, that man also had reasons to leave his dog behind.

Yet by doing so, he guided the negativity to his new self using habits he didn't kill in his pasts.

Orphelinat La Mission De Dieu (God’s Mission Orphanage) is an orphanage located at 29 AVENUE DU COMMERCE, COMMUNE DE
NGALIEMA
BINZA - DELVAUX, KINSHASA, CONGO
DRC.
<br>
<br>
It opened its doors in 2011 and it is now comprised of 40 orphans and 9 workers.<br>
"There are children that are always rejected and I get called always by the state to pick them but it's been a while I
am refusing to take new children because I barely have enough to feed the 40 I have", said Maurice Bosenga.<br>
The orphanage comprinsing of children's age ranging from 3 years old to 17 faces many challenges at present
including:

<!--
The main challenge being food and shelter, your funds will really help go towards building them a home (you can
follow
the progress here), feeding them three times a day, and the rest of the money be used for school and medical needs.
<br>
<br>
You can follow the updates for each need (food, shelter, education, health, and clothes), Including when they are
being
fulfilled.

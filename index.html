It opened its doors in 2011 and it is now comprised of 40 orphans and 9 workers.<br>
"There are children that are always rejected and I get often called by the state to pick them but it's been a while I
am refusing to take new children because I barely have enough to feed the 40 I have", said Maurice Bosenga.<br>
The orphanage comprinsing of children's age ranging from 3 years old to 17 faces many challenges at present
including:

He is saying that due to the lack of funds she hasn't gone to the hospital "there isn't realy money to bring her to the
hospital" he says.

According to Maurice, she is suffering from typhoid and "badly treated malaria" , which according to him needs "dynamic
treatment".

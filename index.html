<b>Orphelinat La Mission De Dieu (God’s Mission Orphanage)</b> is an orphanage located in The Democratic Republic Of the Congo, at 29 AVENUE DU COMMERCE COMMUNE
DE
NGALIEMA
BINZA - DELVAUX, KINSHASA.
<br>
<br>
The orphanage started in 2011 and is still opened today.<br>
Comprised of 47 orphans, with ages ranging from 2 to 17, the workers of the orphanage are always driven by the compassion that comes with seeing orphans becoming bandits (kulunas in Lingala) when they grow up, especially in Kinshasa where they develop violent mentalities.<br><br>
"There are children that are always rejected and I get often called by the state to pick them but it's been a while I am refusing to take new children because I barely have enough to feed the ones I have", said Maurice Bosenza, the manager of the orphanage.<br>

<h1>The most urgent orphanage's needs are:</h1>

<h3>Feeding the children three times a day</h3>

<h3>Sheltering the children</h3>
Thanks to last year's November campaign, the orphanage managed to place a deposit on a land. They had realised that as most money goes to renting, if this need is alleviated, most other needs will not be as difficult, because the money they would have been used to pay rent would then be going to other basic needs.

<b>Here I believe is where they need your help the most, and where every bit can go a long way...</b>

He is saying that due to the lack of funds she hasn't gone to the hospital "there isn't realy money to bring her to the
hospital" he says.
<br>
According to Maurice, she is suffering from typhoid and "badly treated malaria" , which according to him needs "dynamic
treatment".
